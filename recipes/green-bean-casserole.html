    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      You'll never settle for the casserole that uses<br />
      canned soups again after eating a scoop of this grandma-approved dish.<br />
      Sour cream helps create the rich sauce, while buttery crackers make a crunchy topping.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Butter: You'll use two tablespoons of butter for the green beans and two tablespoons for the topping.</li>
        <li>Flour: All-purpose flour thickens the green bean mixture, resulting in a decadent casserole.</li>
        <li>Sour cream: A cup of sour cream adds richness and pleasant tanginess.</li>
        <li>Onion: Diced white onion lends complexity, taking the flavor up a notch.</li>
        <li>Seasonings: A teaspoon of salt enhances the other flavors, while a teaspoon of sugar lends a touch of subtle sweetness.</li>
        <li>Green beans: This recipe calls for three cans of French-style green beans. You can use fresh green beans if you prefer.</li>
        <li>Cheese: You can use pre-shredded Cheddar cheese, but freshly grated is always best.</li>
        <li>Cracker crumbs: Buttery cracker crumbs give the topping a welcome crunch.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the casserole: Melt butter in a large skillet, then add flour and cook for about a minute. Stir in sour cream, onion, salt, and sugar. Add green beans and toss to coat.</li>
        <li>Top the casserole: Transfer the mixture to a casserole dish. Spread the cheese over the green bean mixture. Mix the melted butter and crumbs, then sprinkle evenly over the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake the casserole: Bake in the preheated oven until the topping is golden and bubbly.</li>
    </ol>
